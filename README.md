 ||Business Requirements Specification|Software Requirements Specification|Software Design Specification|
 |-|---|---|---|
 |Referred as|  **BRS**| **SRS**|**SDS**|
|Definition| A formal document that describes the various requirements provided by the business & describes the various requirements provided by the client.|	It specifies the functional and non-functional requirements present in the software. | Describe the actual software, most from a technical perpective.|

|Created by|a business analyst.| a system analyst or a system architect. _refer Note_ **SRS Created by.** |Development team.|
|Decribes|	the functional specifications of the software at a very high level.| the technical and functional specification of the software also at a high level.|

> [!NOTE]
> **_SRS vs SDS._** SDS may contain limitation that is unable to cater to the SRS and/or has features additional that SRS did not have a need.\
> **_SRS Created by._**  Although, in some companies, the business analyst can also create an SRS. Some companies do not even have an SRS, instead, they make their BRS detailed enough so that it can be used as SRS.

## Relationships

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is important to understand that BRS is not neccessarily a 1 to 1 match. There may be intances that the BRS needs to be developed using 2 or more SRS. Or a few BRS can be handled by an SRS.
